2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PLIO-8#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal LEDS[0] has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-8#2 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal LEDS[1] has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-8#3 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal LEDS[2] has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-8#4 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal LEDS[3] has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required
